#summary Guilds that use EPGP

A large portion of the guilds that use EPGP have their data uploaded on [EPGPWeb](http://epgpweb.appspot.com/). [EPGPWeb](http://epgpweb.appspot.com/) provides a search function with which you can search for your guild or others. For example you can search for:

  * Region: example [eu](http://epgpweb.appspot.com/search?q=eu)
  * Realm: example [Sunstrider](http://epgpweb.appspot.com/search?q=sunstrider)
  * Guild: example [Aphorism](http://epgpweb.appspot.com/search?q=aphorism)

Just login to your account and open a page on any of your guild's standings. On the right of the page you will see the status panel from which you can edit the administrators and change the link to the guild's website._
