# Introduction #

EPGP has had a few changes for Dragon Soul that you should know about.

  * Trinket pricing is lower -- roughly 83% the price as in 4.2 (aka, a multiplier of 1.25 rather than 1.50)
  * **T13 loot**, including Crystallized Firestones
  * (Hopefully) fixed the annoying "config resetting itself" issue

# Details #

Okay, so there isn't much; mostly bug fixes and tweaks.
