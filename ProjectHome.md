EPGP is an Effort/Gear reward system and addon for World of Warcraft. The addon stores information in game so unlike other systems it doesn't require an outside website with a database backend to keep the DKP standings. **As of version 5.3 it can also export data to [EPGPWeb](http://www.epgpweb.com/) for backup and offgame purposes.**

Check the [Wiki](Home.md) for documentation on both the [EPGP system](TheSystem.md) and [the addon](TheAddon.md).

This addon and system was designed and implemented in my free time. It is available for you for free. In the rare case you feel you want to give something back, you can donate using the link below. Or you can drop by the [forums](http://groups.google.com/group/epgp-discuss) and say thanks.
